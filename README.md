# Schedulize

Schedulize is a application that will display links and relevant materials based on your set schedule.

I created this application since I had to open various links and materials everyday for class. So I decided, why not automate it? So that's exactly what I did. 

Please see the [goals.txt](goals.txt) file to see the current goals of the application.
